I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student with a calm, organized, and collaborative mindset, on an exciting journey to become a full-stack software engineer. I've explored a diverse range of courses—from software development and data structures to machine learning and computer graphics—which have fueled my passion for building efficient, informative, and visually engaging applications. I enjoy automating tasks for fun and productivity, and I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of creativity and mathematics, especially in 3D graphics using tools like Three.js. 

Outside of coding, I recharge through gardening, spending time with my cats, and immersing myself in the outdoors—whether it's hiking, fishing, skiing, or camping. I also love reading across a wide range of topics, including sociology, anthropology, philosophy and technology, always looking to broaden my perspective and bring fresh ideas into my life and work.
